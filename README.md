Temporal Object
===============

This is a first stab at creating a RubyGem to implement Martin Fowler's "Temporal Objects" paradigm.

So far there are time comparators.  TemporalObject::RelativeTime just inherits from DateTime (for now).

IT IS NOT YET READY FOR PRIME TIME!  Do not use.  I will be refactoring, so the API *will* be changing.  Thanks.

BELOW, all forms of "to be" are equivalent for representational purposes.
Will a list of cannonical traits for places, persons, animals, artifacts [and typs of artifcts], for conflits, themes, etc.
  e.g., persons:  vitality, [any of physical traits], social class, legal status [e.g., minor, adult, military, clergy, prisoner, noble, serf, legislator]

Traits can be additive or displacive.  Reaching the age of majority, a child is now an adult, and loses the 'minor' tag for 'adult'.

But if Tom falls in love with Luis, he doesn't stop loving Alice automatically.   When Tom is elected to parliment he is still a citizen.

Many traits can happen at the same time.  E.g, a village is bombed, and many die.  The 'vitality=dead' will have the same time stamp for many characters.  Code must be able to handle multiple simultaneous traits, returning not just 'before' or 'after' but also 'equal' in time.

Traits could be a Ruby array.  In the case of displacive traits, there must be a link to the previous trait to show its displacement.  
However, a replacement value trait won't negate the additive prededecessor.  (So when Tom is impeached from Parliment he is still a citizen.
